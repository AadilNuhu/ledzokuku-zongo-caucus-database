            <h2>Welcome to My Portfolio</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my professional portfolio! I am <span>Aadil Nuhu</span>, a passionate <span>Software</span> and <span>Web developer</span> with a flair for creating visually appealing and highly functional websites. My work is driven by the desire to combine aesthetics with usability to deliver the best possible user experience.</p>
            <p>With over <span>2 years of experience</span> in the industry, I have developed a diverse skill set that spans <span>front-end development, user experience (UX) design, and interactive media</span>. My expertise includes working with <span>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL</span> and modern frameworks like <span>React</span> and <span>Bootstrap</span>. I also have a solid understanding of <span>back-end technologies</span>, which enables me to build <span>full-stack applications</span> that are both powerful and scalable.</p>
            <p>My approach is centered around understanding the unique needs of each client. I take the time to listen and gather insights about your vision and goals. This collaborative process ensures that the solutions I provide are tailored to your specific requirements and deliver maximum value.</p>
            <p>When I'm not coding, I enjoy playing games, watching movies, participating in coding challenges etc. These hobbies keep me inspired and creative, and often influence my work in subtle ways. I am always on the lookout for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow.</p>

            <h2>My Process</h2>
            <div class="process-step">
                <h3>1. Discovery & Planning</h3>
                <p>The first step in any project is to understand your needs and objectives. I conduct thorough research and gather requirements to ensure a clear understanding of your goals. This phase includes defining project scope, target audience, and key features.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="process-step">
                <h3>2. Design</h3>
                <p>Next, I create design mockups and wireframes to visualize the project's look and feel. This phase involves developing a user-friendly interface that aligns with your brand and enhances the user experience. I use tools like Adobe XD and Figma to design engaging and responsive layouts.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="process-step">
                <h3>3. Development</h3>
                <p>Once the design is finalized, I move on to development. This involves coding the front-end and back-end of the website or application, ensuring that all features work seamlessly and that the site is optimized for performance and accessibility.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="process-step">
                <h3>4. Testing & Launch</h3>
                <p>Before launching, I conduct rigorous testing to identify and fix any issues. This includes checking for bugs, ensuring cross-browser compatibility, and verifying that the site performs well on various devices. After thorough testing, I prepare for a smooth launch.</p>
            </div>

                <h3>5. Maintenance & Support</h3>
